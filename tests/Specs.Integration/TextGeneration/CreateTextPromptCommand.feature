Feature: Create Text Prompt Command
As a author
When I start a new text prompt and enter an initial prompt
Then I should see the text prompt created with the initial response

Scenario: Create Text Prompt
	Given I have a def "<def>"
	And I have a initial prompt "<prompt>"
	And I have a text prompt id "<id>"
	And The text prompt exists "<TextPromptExists>"
	When I create a text prompt with the prompt 
	Then I see the text prompt created with the initial response "<response>"
	And if the response has validation issues I see the "<responseErrors>" in the response
 
Examples:
	| def                       | response   | responseErrors | id                                   | TextPromptExists | prompt                   |
